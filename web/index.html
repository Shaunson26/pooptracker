    <h1>Poopy poops</h1>
    <p>Pooping is an activity that we all engage in. It is the process by which we expel
      solid waste material as a byproduct of our daily food consumption. For some,
      like me, it can be a euphoric moment. But for others, it can be painful. There
      are many poop tracking apps in the wild that allow you understand your pooping
      characteristics.</p>
      
      <p>I used an app - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appstronautstudios.pooplog" target="_blank">Poop Tracker app by Appstronaut Studios</a>) 
         - to track my habits for over 3 years. Below is the summarised data, so let me take you on my poop journey!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-container w3-section">
    <h1>The data</h1>
    <p>I have been tracking my poops since <strong id='start_date'></strong>.
      The data below was captured until <strong id='end_date'></strong>, and is
      thus from <strong id='n_days'></strong>, <strong id='n_months'></strong>, or
      <strong id='n_years'></strong>.
    </p>
    <p>I have pooped <strong id='n_poops'></strong> times in this period. Impressive!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-container w3-section">
    <h2>Poops per day</h2>
    <p>I generally poop about <strong id='likely_n_poop'></strong> per day.
      My poop rate is <strong id='poop_rate'></strong>. This is considered normal in popular media(<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-many-times-should-you-poop-a-day">see here</a>).</p>

    <div class="w3-container w3-card chart-container">

  </div>

  <div class="w3-container w3-section">
    <h2>The pooping hour</h2>
    <p>I like to poop around <strong id='likely_poop_time'></strong> hours, and most often
      between <strong id='often_poop_time'></strong> hours. Being regular is considered healthy, and while there is no "best"
    time to poop, the our bodies seem primed to poop in the morning after sleep (<a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-time-of-the-day-to-poop-8642393">see here</a>).</p>

  <div class="w3-container w3-section">
    <h2>Size and shape</h2>

    <p> As long as we are not pooping pellets or thin poops, we should be good 
      (<a href="https://www.healthpartners.com/blog/healthy-poop-chart/">see here</a>).</p>

    <p>The poop quantities that I poop are a little hard to measure.
      I do this through sensation, so the quantities are probably not that accurate.
      I most often sense that I poop of <strong id='often_poop_size'></strong> quantities.</p>
   
    <div class="w3-container w3-card chart-container">
      <canvas id="plot-quantity"></canvas>
    </div>

    <p>The Bristol Stool Chart categorizes poops into 7 types. My poop is
      usually a shaped like a <strong id='often_poop_type'></strong>.</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="w3-container w3-section">
    <h2>Places de poop</h2>
    <p>I generally poop at <strong id='often_poop_place'></strong>, but also poop regularly at work or at a family members place.</p>

  <div class="w3-container w3-section">
    <h2>Moving onwards</h2>
    <p>That concludes my poop journey. I hope you had a pleasant trip.
      Iâ€™d like to leave you with some thought provoking questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How many poops do you do a day?</li>
      <li>What time do you normally poop?</li>
      <li>What are the characteristic size and shape of your poop?</li>
      <li>Where is your favourite place to poop?</li>
    </ul>
